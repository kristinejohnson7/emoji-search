<EmojiRow>
Download the json file attached to this lesson for a list of emojis and add it to your project.
The list should show a maximum of 20 results
As a user types into the search bar the list should begin to filter the results.
Each row should change color on hover
A user can click a row and copy to the emoji to their clipboard (i.e. a user clicks the row, it copies the emoji to their clipboard and they can paste it into a document).
